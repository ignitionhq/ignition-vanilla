// VIEWPORT
// Identify relevant viewport features.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Breakpoints

// Set the viewport widths that signal style adjustments. Mind that breakpoint
// values represent the lower bound from which styles are applied. Phones and
// other small screen devices require no dedicated breakpoint because ordinary
// classes are used to target them. Desktops will usually share styles with
// laptops and similarly sized screens or make use of styles established by
// ordinary classes.
$breakpoints: (
  tablet: 720px,
  laptop: 1080px
