## Documentation

Spark Vanilla establishes a solid architecture, consistent naming conventions, and a collection of basic building blocks, that provide a sturdy starting point for developing web-based interfaces of any size or complexity. It is extremely lightweight, requiring only basic CSS and Sass knowledge in order to understand. Furthermore, source code is thoroughly commented to reveal use cases and clarify quirks.

Items are organized into distinct categories, as follows.

### Settings

This is where global configuration options are managed. The color palette, decorative attributes, layout, spacing, typography, and viewport options are defined here for use across the whole project.

### Helpers

Recurring tasks are abstracted so that they can be reused across various components or patterns. Breakpoint or grid generation are two such actions defined via mixins.

### Basics

Styling inconsistencies are present even across modern browsers. Establishing a minimal set of default traits ensures a reliable foundation on which components can be built.

### Components

These are the main building blocks of any interface. The framework provides a limited number of common components in order to establish a lean starting point.

### Organizers

Structural patterns, such as grids, used to arrange items in a coherent layout are defined here.

### Utilities

Single-purpose utility classes provide widespread unique traits that are required in various contexts.
